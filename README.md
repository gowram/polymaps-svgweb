This is an attempt to make Polymaps (http://polymaps.org) work with svgweb
(http://code.google.com/p/svgweb/), a Flash implementation of SVG made for
browsers without native SVG support.

In order to test this, you will need to run a local web server. We've included
the one that ships with svgweb for testing, and you can start it with:

$ make run-server

from this directory. Then visit:

http://localhost:8080/examples/svgweb.html

to see the demo.
